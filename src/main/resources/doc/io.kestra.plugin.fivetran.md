# How to use the Fivetran plugin

Trigger Fivetran connector syncs from Kestra flows and optionally wait for completion.

## Authentication

Set `apiKey` and `apiSecret` (both required) for HTTP Basic authentication against the Fivetran API. Store secrets in [secrets](https://kestra.io/docs/concepts/secret) and apply connection properties globally with [plugin defaults](https://kestra.io/docs/workflow-components/plugin-defaults).

## Tasks

`connectors.Sync` triggers a sync for a `connectorId` (required) and waits for completion by default (`wait: true`). Set `force: true` to cancel any active sync before starting a new one — by default a running sync is left as-is and the task skips. Cap wait time with `maxDuration` (default 60 minutes).
